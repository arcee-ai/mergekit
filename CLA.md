# Arcee Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to software projects managed by Arcee AI, Inc. ("Arcee", "We", or "Us"). To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Arcee must have on file a signed Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") from each Contributor, indicating agreement with the license terms below. This agreement is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Arcee and its users. It does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

By accepting and agreeing to these terms and conditions You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your past, present and future Contributions Submitted to Arcee. In return, Arcee shall consider Your Contributions for inclusion (or continued inclusion) in the official Arcee project for which they were Submitted. Except for the license granted herein to Arcee and recipients of software distributed by Arcee, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

### 2.1 Copyright License

To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Arcee and to recipients of software distributed by Arcee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 3. Representations and Warranties

You represent that:

(a) You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.

(b) You own the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution which are required to grant the rights under Section 2.

(c) The grant of rights under Section 2 does not violate any assignment or grant of rights which You have made to third parties, including Your employer. If Your Contributions were created in the course of Your employment with (or are otherwise owned by) Your past or present employer(s), You represent that such employer(s) has authorized You to make Contributions on behalf of such employer(s) on the terms set forth herein, or such employer(s) has waived all of their right, title, or interest in or to Your Contributions.

(d) You have followed the instructions provided by Arcee if You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship Submitted.
